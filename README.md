## Virus

This package contains the [EICAR Signature test string](http://www.eicar.org/86-0-Intended-use.html),
it's harmless but used by most antivirus to trigger and test the alert system
by detecting this signature as a virus.

### Wikipedia

The EICAR Standard Anti-Virus Test File or EICAR test file is a computer file that
was developed by the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR)
and Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO), to test the response of
computer antivirus (AV) programs. Instead of using real malware, which could do
real damage, this test file allows people to test anti-virus software without
having to use a real computer virus.

Anti-virus programmers set the EICAR string as a verified virus, similar to
other identified signatures. A compliant virus scanner, when detecting the file,
will respond in exactly the same manner as if it found a harmful virus. Not all
virus scanners are compliant, and may not detect the file even when they are
correctly configured.

The use of the EICAR test string can be more versatile than straightforward
detection: a file containing the EICAR test string can be compressed or
archived, and then the antivirus software can be run to see whether it can
detect the test string in the compressed file.

### Testing

If you have an anti-virus installed in your computer, it should alert you about
EICAR Standard Signature Test as soon as you download this package.

To test if this package is working you need to have `clamav` installed, if you
don't have, fallow this steps:

```bash
sudo apt-get install clamav && sudo freshclam -v
```

After that you can run the test suit:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cranic/node-virus ./virus
cd virus && npm install && make test
```
